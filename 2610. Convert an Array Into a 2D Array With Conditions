You are given an integer array nums. You need to create a 2D array from nums satisfying the following conditions:

The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array nums.
Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.
Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Note that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:
- 1,3,4,2
- 1,3
- 1
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length

Solution:

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findMatrix(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();
        for(int num : nums){
            mp.put(num,mp.getOrDefault(num,0)+1);
            if(ans.size()<mp.get(num)) ans.add(new ArrayList<>());
            ans.get(mp.get(num) - 1).add(num);
        }
        return ans;
    }

Explaination:
->Here we used the hashmap for checking how many times the elememt occured ,because the frequency of element decide's in which row it can be placed.
->Ex:If ele occured once it will kept in list 1 , if same ele occure second time place in list2 and soon.
->we comparing  occurence of ele with the ans list size,if it is more then ans list size we wil, add a new list to ans and keep ,this elemet init.
->if not the ele can be kept in the list which already created ,so we get the value of the ele from the map and place the ele in the array list at thet index in the ans array list.
->By doing the above method when  ele which alredy existed in present row come's then it will be add to new row by creating the new array for that ele so that the duplicate's
  row ele's can be avoided.
